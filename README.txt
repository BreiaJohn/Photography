Highlights by HTML5 UP

I accessed this template from html5 up. The goal of this project was to create a quick site that I could use for my photography business. I hope you enjoyed the changes that I made to the site and my own unique spin for my own personal use!

PS: Not sure how to get that contact form working? Give formspree.io a try (it's awesome).
